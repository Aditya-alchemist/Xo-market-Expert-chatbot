Basics
What is XO Market?
XO Market is the first conviction marketplace, enabling anyone to create and trade markets based on their strongly held beliefs.

In a conviction market, users stake financial value behind their level of confidence in an outcome - either by creating a market on that outcome or trading shares in it. This approach removes traditional gatekeepers to market creation, bringing liquidity and insight to previously inaccessible or niche topics.

As a new paradigm in prediction markets, conviction markets remove the centralized gatekeepers to market creation associated with established models. This approach brings liquidity and insight to previously inaccessible markets, rewarding those who surface valuable information through their conviction. For the surplus of niche communities underserved by prediction markets, XO Market provides a platform for members to directly price, share, and validate the outcomes that matter to them most.

In line with this vision, we’re excited to launch the XO Market Alpha, a first step toward making conviction markets accessible to everyone.

The Alpha is an invite-only testnet where you can try XO’s core features using pre-funded test tokens, all in a risk-free environment. You’ll be able to trade instantly, see real-time pricing, and experience transparent market resolution, while helping shape XO before it goes public.

XO Market’s Alpha Phase is now live. Redeem your invite code to access the platform and receive a pre-funded account with test tokens (tUSDC, tSOL, tTIA).

What is a conviction market?
A conviction market is an open financial platform where anyone can turn a strongly held belief into a tradable asset. These markets enable users to create questions about real-world outcomes - anything from major news events to niche community topics - and then allow others to trade YES/NO shares on those outcomes.

When you create a conviction market, you define the question, set clear resolution criteria, and provide initial liquidity to start trading. As others buy and sell shares in possible outcomes, prices update in real time, reflecting the crowd’s evolving consensus and the strength of conviction behind each side. A rising price signals growing belief; a falling price reflects skepticism. These prices represent the live, crowd-sourced probability for each outcome.

Conviction markets are designed for broad accessibility. Anyone can sign up and participate, regardless of expertise or background, and can trade on topics they care about. XO removes traditional barriers with simple onboarding, gasless trading, and support for a range of currencies.

When the event in question is resolved, XO’s automated oracle reviews public data and the market’s rules to determine the correct outcome. If there’s a challenge, the community can participate in verifying the result. Once finalized, winnings are distributed automatically and transparently.

In conviction markets, the more insight or conviction you have, the greater your potential reward. As conviction markets mature, they open up new ways for individuals and communities to price, share, and profit from what they know.

How are conviction markets different from prediction markets?
Prediction markets are financial platforms where users buy and sell shares based on the outcome of a future event. Share prices reflect the crowd-implied probability of that event occurring.

While prediction markets have demonstrated accuracy in aggregating information and forecasting outcomes, their utility has historically been constrained by two main factors: centralized market creation and a focus on major, highly visible events.

In a typical prediction market, new markets are created and managed by a centralized entity or platform administrator. This limits the scope of tradable outcomes and enforces a “top-down” approach to information discovery.

Conviction markets, as implemented by XO, extend this framework by opening market creation. Any user can list an outcome and define its resolution criteria. This open model significantly broadens the range of covered topics, supporting long-tail markets that reflect the specific interests, knowledge, and convictions of diverse user groups.

From a technical perspective, both market types involve users trading based on perceived outcomes. The key difference is structural:

Prediction markets operate within a top-down, administrator-controlled environment.
Conviction markets are bottom-up and user-driven.
This open structure results in a vastly broader spectrum of tradable outcomes, especially for long-tail events and emerging trends.

Access and Getting Started
Who can use XO Market, and what does “Alpha” mean?
Right now, XO Market is in Alpha, which means access is limited to invited users. During this Alpha phase, only users with invite codes can join the platform. This controlled rollout lets the team test the platform in a lower-volume setting, gather feedback, and make rapid improvements while ensuring the community grows gradually and remains high-quality. It also means the developers can perform occasional resets or big updates if needed without affecting a large user base.

All trading on XO during Alpha uses test tokens with no real-world value. When you join, you receive a pre-funded balance of test currencies (e.g. tUSDC, tSOL, tTIA) to use on the platform. Certain features - like real-money deposits, withdrawals, and user-created markets - are temporarily disabled in Alpha. This sandbox approach provides a low-risk environment for early adopters and the founding community to try out XO Market’s features. As XO moves to Beta and beyond, these restrictions will be lifted (see When will full features launch? below).

How can I get an invite code?
Access to XO Market Alpha is by invite only. If you don’t already have an invite code, here are the primary ways to get one:

Join the waitlist: Sign up on the XO Market website or app to be notified when new invite codes become available. Invite links are emailed out to waitlisted users as slots open up.
Engage with the community: The XO team occasionally distributes invite codes through community channels like Discord and Twitter (X), especially to active participants and supporters.
Watch for special drops: During Alpha, there may be social campaigns or community events where extra invite codes are given out as rewards.
Early supporter outreach: Early supporters and contributors sometimes receive codes directly from the XO team as a thank-you.
If you don’t yet have a code, the best approach is to join the waitlist and stay connected via Twitter or Discord. The team is periodically onboarding new users as capacity expands. Being active in the community and keeping an eye on official announcements will increase your chances of securing early access.

How do I get started on XO Market?
Getting started on XO Market is straightforward. Once you have an invite code in hand, here are the steps to begin trading on the platform:

Sign up / Log in: Visit the XO Market Alpha and click “Sign In.” You can choose a login method that suits you - email, Google, Twitter/X, or a crypto wallet. XO Market uses an authentication service called Privy, which will automatically create a secure, non-custodial crypto wallet for you on your first login if you don’t connect an existing wallet.
Enter your invite code: Since this is the Alpha phase, after signing in you’ll be prompted to enter an invite code to actually access the app. Input your code to unlock the platform. If your code is valid, you’ll pass through the gate.
Receive test funds: Once you’re in, XO will greet you with a welcome message and automatically credit your account with some test tokens to trade. Currently, new Alpha users get 1,000 tUSDC, 100 tTIA, and 10 tSOL deposited into their wallet. These tokens are only usable within XO’s Alpha; they carry no real-world value and are meant solely for testing. Think of it as play money to explore the markets.
Start exploring and trading: With your account funded by test tokens, you’re all set to experience the platform. You can by browsing the markets. When you find a market question that interests you, click it to view details like the description, resolution criteria, and price graph. From there, you can enter a trade by selecting YES or NO, inputting the amount of tokens you want to stake, and confirming the trade. Trades execute instantly since XO uses an automated market maker. After trading, you can track your positions in your Portfolio (accessible in your profile) and see how the odds move. Feel free to try multiple markets and see how the platform responds. Everything is risk-free during Alpha, so it’s a great time to learn the ropes!
That’s it - after those steps, you’re officially using XO Market. Explore features like commenting on markets, sharing market links or your trades (XO generates a nice shareable image of your position after each trade), and engaging with other traders on the platform. The Alpha phase is about experimenting and giving feedback, so have fun and don’t hesitate to ask questions in the community if you need help.

Trading Markets
How do I make my first trade on XO Market?
Getting started with trading on XO Market is intentionally frictionless, whether you’re a crypto veteran or a total newcomer. Once you’ve signed up and accessed the platform, making your first trade involves just a handful of steps:

Browse or search for a market: Head to the Markets page. You’ll see a live list of trending, featured, and newly-created markets. Each market has a question, description, current odds, and a quick-glance price chart.
Choose a market that interests you: Click on any market tile to see the full market details, including the resolution criteria and recent price action. Make sure you understand the question being asked and the timeline for resolution.
Decide your conviction: Every market has two sides: YES and NO. Check the current price (e.g. 62% YES means a YES share costs 0.62 tokens). If you think the real outcome is underpriced, this is your edge. If you think it’s overpriced, you can take the other side.
Enter your trade: On the market page, select either YES or NO. Enter the amount you want to trade. The platform will automatically show you the implied probability, the cost of your trade, and your potential payout if your prediction is correct.
Confirm and place your order: Review your order details. Hit Trade. Your trade is executed instantly - there’s no waiting for a counterparty or slow blockchain confirmation. Your new position appears in your portfolio, and the market odds will update to reflect your action.
Track your performance: You can monitor all your active markets and potential profit and loss in your Portfolio. If you change your mind before resolution, you can always buy or sell shares at the latest market price.
Wait for resolution: Once the real-world event resolves, the XO Oracle finalizes the outcome. If you backed the correct side, your payout is automatic and instant. If you want, you can share your trade or victory on social media straight from the app.
Tip: There are no minimums, no gas fees, and no waiting. The interface is intentionally fast and beginner-friendly. Don’t be afraid to experiment in Alpha - it’s all test tokens, so you can learn the system with zero risk.

How does XO Market provide liquidity to markets?
XO Market uses the Liquidity-Sensitive Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LS-LMSR) as its Automated Market Maker (AMM) to provide consistent liquidity and ensure every market is always tradable. This means traders can buy or sell shares at any time, and the price is determined algorithmically based on the current state of the market.

When a user creates a market, they must provide an initial liquidity seed into the market’s pool. This initial liquidity subsidizes the market maker’s cost function and sets an opening price. Providing this seed capital enables active trading from the moment the market launches. In exchange for committing this capital (and taking on the AMM’s bounded risk of loss), market creators earn a fee on all trades in their market.

This structure incentivizes the creation of popular, liquid markets while still ensuring that even relatively illiquid markets have continuous pricing. The LS-LMSR mechanism guarantees that there is always a price at which shares can be bought or sold, though the less liquidity in the pool, the higher the slippage will be for a given trade.

In each market, prices are determined by the LS-LMSR cost function, which depends on the total shares in circulation and the liquidity parameter. Whenever a user makes a trade, the cost function is used to quote a fair price for the order without needing an order book or direct counterparty.

Unique to the LS-LMSR’s cost function is its liquidity sensitivity. The parameter b determines the “depth” of the market (how resistant the price is to moving when trades occur):

A higher b means larger trades cause less slippage (each trade moves the price by a smaller amount). The market can absorb bigger orders with only slight price changes.
A lower b means even small trades cause more slippage (each trade moves the price more significantly). The market is shallow, and prices will jump around more with trading.
On XO, b is not fixed. Instead, it dynamically adjusts based on the market’s total value locked (TVL) in the liquidity pool. In simple terms, as more liquidity enters the pool, the market maker increases b, making the market deeper so that trading becomes more efficient. The exact formula uses a protocol constant K to scale b relative to TVL. This dynamic liquidity parameter ensures that highly funded markets become very liquid, while smaller markets are still functional but naturally more volatile.

How do points and rankings work on XO Market?
XO Market features a deep and dynamic points system to track your engagement, skill, and contributions across the platform. This system rewards active traders, skilled forecasters, market creators, and even social contributors. Here’s what you should know:

Points are earned through activity: Every action you take has the potential to earn you points. Trading and market interaction are the core sources, but creative contributions and community support can also be rewarded.
Not all points are created equal: The platform uses different point types for different kinds of contributions (e.g., trade volume, accuracy, reputation, special achievements). You’ll see your primary points balance and, at higher levels, may unlock more granular stats.
Rankings reflect both participation: XO’s leaderboard is not just about who trades the most. The algorithm takes into account a blend of activity, accuracy, and longer-term contribution to the ecosystem. Points may be subject to decay, bonuses, or multipliers based on streaks, creativity, or community impact.
Tiers and rewards: As you accumulate points, you’ll unlock tiers (e.g. Rookie, Pro, Legend, etc.). Each tier comes with certain bonuses such as:
Access to create markets
Higher referral bonuses
Early access to new features
Community recognition and exclusive Discord roles
Potential eligibility for token rewards or airdrops at mainnet
Leaderboard and public stats: Your main points, tier, and ranking are visible on your profile. The global leaderboard showcases top performers, but everyone can track their own progress and set goals for climbing higher.
Keep an eye on your stats, aim for the next tier, and don’t be afraid to try new ways to get involved!

Does XO Market charge fees?
Trading on XO Market is fee-less in terms of gas (no blockchain transaction fees) but there are two small fees on each trade itself:

Protocol market fee (1%): A 1% fee is applied to the notional value of every trade. This is a platform fee that goes to the XO protocol’s treasury (eventually governed by a DAO).
Creator fee (0-1%): If the market’s creator has set a creator fee for their market (they can choose 0%, 0.5%, or 1%), that fee is applied to each trade as well. The creator fee portion is paid out to the market’s creator as compensation for providing liquidity and creating the market.
These fees are deducted at the time of trade execution, directly from the amount you pay for your shares. In other words, the price you pay to buy shares already includes any fees - there are no additional fees taken later when the market resolves. This also means that fees do not reduce your payout at resolution, since they’ve been collected upfront.

For example, if you buy $100 worth of YES shares in a market with a 1% creator fee, you would pay a total of $2 in fees ($1 protocol fee + $1 creator fee) which is embedded in your trade cost. If the market had a 0% creator fee, you’d pay only the $1 protocol fee on a $100 trade.

XO Market’s network has no gas fees for transactions, so you won’t pay anything beyond the above trade fees. Importantly, if a market ends up resolving as Invalid or is voided due to a successful dispute, the platform will refund the original trade cost including any fees. Any protocol or creator fees that were deducted are automatically returned to the traders in such cases via the smart contracts. This ensures traders aren’t penalized by fees if a market is nullified.

Market Mechanics
How does XO Market ensure liquidity in every market?
XO Market uses an automated market maker based on the Liquidity-Sensitive Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LS-LMSR) to provide continuous liquidity in all markets.

Whenever a market is created, the creator must deposit an initial liquidity seed into the market’s pool (a minimum of 50 USDC or equivalent during Beta). This initial capital subsidizes the cost function of the market maker and sets the opening price for the market. In exchange for committing this capital (and taking on the bounded risk of the AMM), the market creator earns a small fee on every trade in that market.

This structure ensures that from the moment a market launches, traders can always buy or sell shares - there’s always some liquidity to fill orders. The LS-LMSR market maker guarantees that there is always a price at which shares can be bought or sold, though the less liquidity in the pool, the higher the slippage will be for a given trade.

In each market, prices are determined by the LS-LMSR cost function, which depends on the total shares in circulation and the liquidity parameter. Whenever a user makes a trade, the cost function is used to quote a fair price for the order without needing an order book or direct counterparty.

Unique to the LS-LMSR’s cost function is its liquidity sensitivity. The parameter b determines the “depth” of the market (how resistant the price is to moving when trades occur):

A higher b means larger trades cause less slippage (each trade moves the price by a smaller amount). The market can absorb bigger orders with only slight price changes.
A lower b means even small trades cause more slippage (each trade moves the price more significantly). The market is shallow, and prices will jump around more with trading.
On XO, b is not fixed. Instead, it dynamically adjusts based on the market’s total value locked (TVL) in the liquidity pool. In simple terms, as more liquidity enters the pool, the market maker increases b, making the market deeper so that trading becomes more efficient. The exact formula uses a protocol constant K to scale b relative to TVL. This dynamic liquidity parameter ensures that highly funded markets become very liquid, while smaller markets are still functional but naturally more volatile.

How are market prices and probabilities determined on XO?
Pricing in each market is determined by the Liquidity-Sensitive Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LS-LMSR) cost function. In an LS-LMSR, the cost of the current state of the market is defined by a formula. For a binary (YES/NO) market with liquidity parameter b, the cost function C is:

C(qY, qN) = b · log(e^(qY/b) + e^(qN/b))
Where qY and qN are the total YES and NO shares purchased, and b is the liquidity parameter.

This cost function increases as more shares are bought. The key property is that the difference in the cost function before and after a trade equals the cost of that trade. In other words, when you buy shares, you pay the increase in C. When you sell shares, you receive the decrease in C. This ensures every order is executed at a fair market price without needing an order book or direct counterparties.

The instantaneous price of a YES share (which also corresponds to the current probability of the outcome) is given by the derivative of the cost function with respect to qY. In practice, it works out to:

pY = e^(qY/b) / (e^(qY/b) + e^(qN/b))
This price always maps directly to the market-implied probability of the event. Whenever a user submits an order, the smart contract recalculates the cost function before and after the trade. It then debits the appropriate amount of collateral from the trader (which is the increase in C for buys, or returns collateral for sells), and mints/burns shares accordingly. This algorithmic market maker ensures that prices update smoothly in response to trading activity: large trades will move the price more (because of the logarithmic curve), while small trades cause minimal price changes. Trading fees are applied to each order (market fee + creator fee) and are taken from the trade cost rather than the final payout.

By using LS-LMSR, XO Market enables efficient price discovery and deep liquidity across both high-volume and specialized markets, supporting the mission to make all convictions tradable.

How are markets resolved?
Market outcomes on XO Market are resolved via the XO Oracle.

When a market reaches its end date (i.e. the event in question has occurred or the deadline for it to occur passes), an AI agent acting as the oracle reviews the event according to the market’s explicit resolution criteria. The AI aggregates and analyzes relevant data sources and then issues a provisional outcome (YES, NO, or Invalid) along with a confidence score indicating how certain it is about this determination.

This provisional result, along with supporting evidence or data citations, is published on-chain and sealed with a cryptographic hash (to ensure it’s tamper-evident). If the AI’s confidence score exceeds the required threshold for auto-resolution, the provisional outcome is immediately proposed as the tentative final result, and a 24-hour challenge period begins.

If there is no dispute (no one challenges the outcome) during this 24-hour window, the outcome is accepted and finalized automatically once the window closes. The smart contracts then release payouts to winning traders and distribute any accrued creator fees, all in one on-chain transaction.

What happens if there is a dispute?
If a user believes a provisional outcome is incorrect or unfair, they can challenge it during the post-resolution challenge-window. To raise a dispute, the challenger submits a conflicting outcome along with supporting evidence and stakes a dispute bond.

Once a market is challenged, the resolution process escalates to a decentralized juror court phase. A panel of jurors is randomly selected from a pool of staked users using a Verifiable Random Function (VRF), with selection probability weighted by the amount of stake each juror has locked.

These jurors are effectively peers in the community entrusted to adjudicate. Jurors privately review all submitted evidence and arguments off-chain. They then cast their votes on-chain using a quadratic voting mechanism. A minimum quorum of juror participation is required for the vote to be valid.

The outcome of the juror vote determines the final result of the market. If the jurors side with the challenger, the provisional outcome is overturned; if they side with the oracle’s original outcome, that outcome stands.

To incentivize honest voting, jurors who voted against the final consensus (i.e. the “losing” side of the dispute) are penalized by slashing a portion of their staked tokens. The slashed amount is redistributed as a reward to the jurors on the correct side and to the user who successfully challenged the outcome. This mechanism encourages jurors to vote truthfully based on the evidence.

Once the dispute is resolved, the market’s outcome is finalized accordingly. At this point, the smart contracts execute final settlement: winning traders receive payouts, the challenger gets their bond back (plus any reward if they won the dispute), and the slashing/reward logic for jurors is applied.

Community & Support
What fees does XO charge on trades?
Yes - the XO community recognizes early and active members with special Discord roles. These roles are like badges of honor that grant recognition (and sometimes access to exclusive channels or events) to contributors. The current roles include:

XO.Rookie: Given to users who complete the onboarding challenges on Zealy - basically a set of basic social and educational tasks to get started.
XO.OG: Awarded to early supporters of XO. Everyone who logged into the initial XO mini-app or participated in the Alpha test gets this OG role.
XO.Creator: A role for outstanding community contributors. Each week, the XO team awards this role to community members who produce exceptional content or other valuable contributions to the project.
Holding one of these roles may grant special perks such as access to private Discord channels, early info on upcoming features, beta testing opportunities, or other exclusive events within the XO community. These roles are a way for the team to thank and highlight people who are helping the platform grow. As the community expands, there may be additional roles or programs introduced, so stay active and you might earn some unique titles!

Miscellaneous
What infrastructure is XO Market built on?
XO Market is built as a sovereign Rollkit based rollup leveraging Celestia for data availability. This specialized design lets XO achieve high throughput and fast transaction finality without the congestion or high gas fees you’d encounter on a general-purpose chain.

In practice, all your actions on XO (trades, etc.) are on-chain transactions, but the platform is gas-free for users - you don’t need to pay gas in SOL/ETH or hold a base token, because the network’s architecture covers those costs. This means using XO feels as smooth as a normal web app, while still benefiting from the security and transparency of blockchain.

Under the hood, XO Market uses a few key technologies: the LS-LMSR automated market maker (to algorithmically manage market pricing and liquidity) and the XO Oracle (to handle outcome resolution via AI and community dispute process) are core parts of the infrastructure.

By building on a dedicated app-chain and tailoring the network for conviction markets, XO can optimize for the use case of conviction markets. This custom infrastructure is aimed at ensuring the platform is scalable, efficient, and secure as it grows.

When will full features launch (real-money trading and open market creation)?
Real-money trading, fiat on-ramps, and permissionless market creation are planned for the Beta phase of XO Market.

Once the Beta launches, all users (not just invitees) will be able to deposit supported tokens, create new markets freely, and trade with real economic value involved. In other words, XO will transition from test tokens to real cryptocurrency and/or fiat at that time. The Beta will still be a testing phase, but on a larger scale and with core features unlocked.

After a successful Beta period and further polishing, the project will proceed to a full Mainnet launch, which will introduce the complete platform features to the general public. Mainnet will mark the end of testing phases - at that point XO Market will be fully open, with real stakes and widespread access. (Keep an eye on XO’s announcements for Beta launch timelines and details as development progresses.)
