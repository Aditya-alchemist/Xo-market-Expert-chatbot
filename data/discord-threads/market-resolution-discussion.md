Hey everyone! I created my first market yesterday about the Oscars and I'm getting nervous about the resolution process. What happens if the source I specified doesn't publish results clearly?

Great question! When you create a market, it's crucial to specify both primary and backup sources. For the Oscars, the Academy's official website is the gold standard, but you could also specify major news outlets like Reuters or AP as backups.

@PredictionMaster_42 I learned this the hard way. My first market about a tech earnings had ambiguous resolution criteria and it got disputed. Always be as specific as possible!

The dispute process isn't scary though. I've been through it twice and the community is pretty fair. You just need to present evidence and let people vote.

@XOTeam_Sarah What if there's a tie or the results are unclear? Like what if two movies tie for an award?

Excellent edge case! For ties, you should specify in your market description what constitutes a "YES" outcome. For example: "Will Movie X win Best Picture?" could specify that ties result in a "YES" outcome, or you could say the market resolves to "NO" unless there's a clear single winner.
