# XO Market Platform Launch: The Future of Prediction Markets is Here

*Published on March 15, 2024*

Today marks a historic milestone in the evolution of prediction markets. After months of development, testing, and community building, we're thrilled to announce the official launch of XO Market - a next-generation decentralized prediction market platform that puts the power of collective intelligence in your hands.
