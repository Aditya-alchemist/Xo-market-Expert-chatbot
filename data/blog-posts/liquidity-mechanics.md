How XO Keeps Markets Liquid


At XO Market we’re making everyone’s convictions tradable. But when it comes to the little guys — the markets without much traction or volume — this can be difficult.

The smaller the market the smaller the liquidity. That means more slippage and larger price swings. The big players stay away from little markets for exactly those reasons. However, when you restrict the means of creation, you miss out on the very thing that makes conviction markets powerful; the long-tail of people’s convictions.

The magic happens when you let everyone launch markets.

Most will stay small, but that’s exactly the point; like social media feeds, this constant churn of new ideas gives the best and most timely ones a chance to catch on, draw in volume, and rise to the top.

But how can you guarantee that all of these tiny markets will be tradable?

The Liquidity Problem
In traditional prediction markets, finding a counterparty can be a headache. These platforms often rely on order books, meaning you need someone on the other side willing to take your bet. If no one shows up, the market stagnates.

Market makers can help fill the gap, but they only stick around if there’s enough volume to justify it. For obscure or “long-tail” questions, that volume often isn’t there. Hence the market goes unmade, leaving interesting ideas stranded without liquidity if they even get made in the first place.

This fragmentation of liquidity (spreading traders thin across many markets) is one reason traditional prediction markets try to keep trading concentrated on a few mainstream events.

At XO Market, we knew from day one that conviction markets — where anyone can spin up a market on any of their beliefs — would face this challenge multiplied. We can’t rely on manual market makers for thousands of user-generated markets, and we don’t want niche topics to suffer from thin order books.

So what was our solution?

Enter the LS-LMSR, our algorithmic market maker designed to keep the action flowing.

How LS-LMSR Scales Liquidity
Our Liquidity Sensitive Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LS-LMSR) builds on a well-proven foundation (Hanson’s logarithmic market scoring rule) but with a twist; it automatically adapts to the trading activity of that market.

Instead of locking in a single liquidity setting on day one, the LS-LMSR starts lean and fattens up only when market activity spikes. Early on, the pot is shallow — just enough to post a price and let the first brave trader make their mark. As more trades roll in, the algorithm widens the pool, smoothing out slippage and giving bigger players the confidence to step in.

Think of it like a street vendor who opens up with just a simple stall. If business stays quiet, there’s no wasted effort. But if a line starts forming, tables unfold, shelves appear, and soon it’s a bustling pop-up store. No overhead for empty aisles, yet plenty of room when shoppers flood in.

Why That Matters for Conviction Markets
The major advantage of the LS-LMSR is enabling markets to scale with less initial investment. Why does this matter? Because if the initial liquidity required to seed a new market is too large then fewer people will take the leap.

Launching a market on XO shouldn’t feel like taking out a second mortgage. With a light initial seed, creators can float bold, niche questions on a whim. If the idea never catches on, their downside stays small. If it does catch on, liquidity grows in lock-step with volume, so by the time larger traders arrive the curve is already deep enough to absorb them.

Early movers benefit, too.

In the first chapter of a market’s life, prices are sensitive; buying ten dollars’ worth might shove the line from forty cents to sixty. That volatility is a feature; it rewards people willing to act before the crowd with greater potential upside. As volume piles up, those same trades barely budge the price, reassuring whales that they can enter without wrecking the spread.

This dynamic liquidity is a game changer:

For traders: LS-LMSR keeps markets liquid and prices honest. Because the pool expands with volume, you rarely hit a “no-counterparty” wall, and a single buy won’t rocket the odds into orbit. Even whale-sized orders get absorbed, so the numbers you see on XO genuinely track the crowd’s sentiment instead of a couple of stray bets.
For creators: It’s launch-and-relax; a modest seed plus a good question is all it takes; if traders bite, the algorithm dynamically adjusts the liquidity sensitivity, adding the extra depth automatically. As volume grows, so do your fee earnings, so a viral market can scale from a handful of trades to thousands without running dry, and you share in the upside.
Everybody wins!

Unlocking the Long Tail
Ultimately, the goal of the LS-LMSR system is to capture the long-tail.

No more dead markets just because they’re niche. No more clunky order books scaring off newcomers. Every idea that someone cares enough about to make a market on can find its crowd and stay tradeable by design.

Adaptive liquidity is a key part of XO Market’s UX; without it, we’d face the same old limitations as every other prediction platform; markets would stay concentrated around big, obvious events, and most creative ideas would never see the light of day. Instead with LS-LMSR anyone can float a market on anything they care about, and know it won’t get stranded or ignored just because it starts small.

This is what sets XO Market apart. Our algorithmic market maker is always working in the background, responding to real demand and flexing its muscle so that markets of all sizes stay live, responsive, and fair. In short, LS-LMSR is the engine that lets XO Market scale to match the full spectrum of human belief.

With this system in place, the era of empty, illiquid markets is over. Every conviction, big or small, gets its shot. Liquidity is no longer a barrier. It’s just another reason to bring your ideas to life on XO Market.
