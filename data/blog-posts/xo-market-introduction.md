XO Market: Permissionless Conviction Marketplace

Hello world, we are XO Market.

XO Market is a conviction market platform, the first of its kind. We’re creating a completely open marketplace where anyone can turn their beliefs into tradable assets, priced in real-time by collective insight. Being a new kind of marketplace, we get asked a lot of questions:

What exactly is a conviction market?
How is XO Market different from existing prediction markets?
When will XO Market be publicly available?
These questions are important, and we’ll get to all of them. But first, let’s address the most crucial question of all:

What problem is XO Market solving?

The Problems with Prediction Markets

Prediction markets aren’t new. In fact, they’ve been around for decades, consistently demonstrating greater accuracy than polls, surveys, or expert committees.

Despite this, their adoption remains relatively low.

Why?

The answer is accessibility, or rather the lack thereof.

The big platforms act as gatekeepers, restricting the creation of markets to centralized administrators. This blocks everyday users from bringing their unique insights to the table, eliminating niche or “long-tail” markets.

Consequently, they cater to the mainstream; national elections, sports championships, or economic indicators. There’s no representation for the vast number of ideas, beliefs and convictions that thrive in more specialized communities.

There is a plethora of communities out there with millions of users discussing, predicting, and debating outcomes that matter uniquely to them. Whether it’s niche subreddits, creator fandoms, or specialized Discord groups the users already exist, but they have nowhere to go.

We built XO Market to change this.

What Actually is a Conviction Market?

Central to XO Market are our conviction markets.

Conviction markets let anyone transform their personal beliefs into tradable, financial instruments. In other words, if you have a conviction, XO Market allows you to put some skin in the game.

As a market creator, you choose a question or prediction, set clear outcome criteria, and specify your fee tier. This means that as trading volume increases, you — as the market creator — earn a portion of the fees generated from every trade. It’s a built-in incentive to surface interesting questions, attract participation, and reward your role in boosting your own markets.

Once you have a market, anyone can participate.

Drop a message in your community and let the users do their thing. People can agree or disagree by trading on that market. And in doing so, they shape the odds, the market, and the signal.

Imagine you’re convinced that your favorite game will release a new update by the end of this month. You create a conviction market titled “New feature coming out this month.” Other people who share or disagree with your belief can then buy or sell shares in the outcomes you added to this market. As they trade, the price of shares in each outcome changes in real-time to reflect the crowd’s consensus.

Simply put, XO Market makes markets out of human conviction. Beliefs become assets — actionable, measurable, and validated by the wisdom of the crowd.

Creating an Open Market
Our team is composed of crypto natives; we’ve seen the problems with Web3 UX first hand.

Things aren’t intuitive.

Users face complexity after complexity.

Nothing ‘just works’ like it should.

If you have to watch a tutorial to make a transaction then chances are you just won’t bother.

Therefore, in pursuit of creating an open marketplace for convictions, we want to remove as many of these UX barriers as possible. The platform as a whole is meant to allow anyone to sign up and start trading. Account abstraction ensures sign up options aren’t limited to a couple of crypto wallets — while fiat onramping solutions make the platform accessible to Web2 users.

This flexibility means communities of all kinds can build in their own niche within XO Market.

But openness on XO Market goes beyond just that; markets aren’t limited to a single token or blockchain. XO Market will support a wide range of ERC-20 and SPL-compatible tokens, allowing communities to create and trade markets using their preferred currencies.

XO Market in Action

Imagine a platform where anything you’re curious about can become a tradable market — especially topics that traditional prediction markets wouldn’t dare touch. On a platform entirely driven by users and their interests the possibilities are endless.

If existing solutions are the mainstream media, XO Market is X/Twitter.

Take internet culture, for instance. Someone creates a market: “Will this new Pepe meme become the biggest meme of the month?” Within minutes, it’s live on XO Market, seeded by the creator and ready for trading. Then they post it on social media. Their post starts blowing up on Twitter.

Immediately, meme enthusiasts, social-media observers, creators, and casual traders jump in. They buy “Yes” or “No” shares based on their convictions, pushing the odds up and down.

When the month ends, our resolution process kicks in. A category specific AI agent checks the resolution rules set by the market creator and cross-references them with the resolution source, determining the correct outcome and resolving the market in seconds. After a brief challenge period those who invested in the correct outcome receive their return.

That’s the lifecycle of a market from a high-level. But this scenario isn’t limited to memes; while that’s going on, a thousand different markets will be going through the same process. Whether it’s niche interests, culture trivia, product launches, financial debates, XO Market turns these everyday curiosities into valuable, actionable, crowd-priced markets.

Join the Conviction Economy
What we have described here is just the tip of the iceberg. Our team is working hard behind the scenes to ship our product and we have many more ideas in the works.

We’re building the first open, global economy for pricing and trading human belief.

The goal is to unlock entirely new ways to capture worldwide sentiment and collective intelligence. Imagine what happens when communities can instantly transform niche ideas into liquid markets, or when organizations can leverage real-time, crowd-sourced signals on any idea to make critical decisions.

We’re in the early stages right now, and we’re building our community from the ground up. So whether you’re a trader looking to monetize insights, a creator curious about audience sentiment, or someone who likes what you see here, this is your chance to join first and become part of our growing community.
