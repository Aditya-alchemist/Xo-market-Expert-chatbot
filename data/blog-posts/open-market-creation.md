What Happens When Anyone Can Launch a Market?

Traditional prediction markets love their gatekeepers. Every market is hand-picked, admin-approved, and pretty often a little bit boring. If it’s not headline news or a safe bet, it never even makes the cut.

Meanwhile, real culture moves fast; memes break, narratives flip, and what matters today isn’t always what mattered yesterday.

Gatekeeping has a logic to it, but results in a lot of missing out. The weird, the niche, and the “how did nobody think of this yet?” ideas get excluded. The result? A market feed that rarely matches the internet’s actual pulse.

XO Market was built to do the opposite. Open market creation means anyone can spin up a market on whatever catches their curiosity. The crowd, not a committee, decides what gets traded.

What an Open Market Actually Looks Like
Once you drop the barriers, the entire shape of the platform changes. If a meme erupts, there’s a market. If an obscure event gets spicy, there’s a market. If two people are beefing, someone’s launched a market to settle it.

The feed starts looking a lot more like Twitter or TikTok: unpredictable, messy, hyper-relevant.

Most markets will never crack the mainstream, and that’s exactly the point. The magic is in the churn. When anyone can create, the long-tail finally gets its shot. Niche questions, local drama, industry gossip — suddenly, all of it’s liquid.

Some fizzle. Some go viral. Most will do ok, but every so often, one will catch the collective imagination and pull in real volume. The constant churn is a feature, not a bug. It keeps the feed fresh, the insights sharp, and the whole experience closer to the real pace of events and culture.

Conviction markets are optimized for this long tail. They don’t get stuck on a handful of big events. Every belief is a potential market. And every user is able to surface the next breakout idea.

Managing the Noise
Of course, permissionless creation has a cost: you get noise, redundancy, and the occasional garbage idea.

Some markets won’t find an audience.

But that’s the price of user generated markets. The alternative (admins) is safe, but it guarantees you’ll miss the long tail and kill the fun.

The trick isn’t to kill noise, but to manage it. That’s where product design and protocol mechanics come in. Trending algos, reputation systems, and creator incentives all push the best ideas to the top. Smart liquidity design (LS-LMSR in our case) makes sure even small markets can survive long enough to find their crowd.

If a market fizzles, the creator can get back 99% of their original seed, no big loss. If it pops, the whole ecosystem wins.

Volume matters here. In older models, liquidity got stuck in a handful of major markets. Everything else was barren. With open creation, the action spreads out. Niche ideas go from zero to no.1 and the market of the week might not even have existed yesterday.

Incentives and Rewards
Here’s what actually changes when you open the floodgates: the signal gets sharper. Every new market is another test of what the crowd actually believes.

Instead of everyone crowding into the same five big headlines, you get thousands of independent opinions, all priced in real time. That means less way more opportunities for smart traders to find (and monetize) their edge.

The upside isn’t just for traders. On XO, market creators set their own fee tiers. If you’re the first to spot a trend, you can launch a market, set your fee, and earn a fee on every trade. If your market catches on, the upside can be serious.

Whether you’re an influencer, a community manager, or just fast have your finger on the pulse, the incentive to surface relevant markets is built in.
