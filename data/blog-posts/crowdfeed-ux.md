CrowdFeed: Making Markets Grandma-Friendly

Prediction markets have been around for a while.

However, despite their potential, they’ve remained a niche corner of finance, unable to cross into mainstream adoption. Why?

In short: they’re too complicated.

This is a problem indicative of Web3 in general; rather than abstracting away complexity, applications retain it to allow for greater flexibility. This might work for you if you are a developer or a crypto-native, but for the average person it makes most dApps unusable.

It’s a UX problem; traditional prediction markets bombard users with jargon, crypto wallet requirements, and confusing interfaces. This complexity drives away the normies, capping the potential of these platforms.

At XO Market, we knew from the beginning that the user experience needs a fundamental shift towards simplicity and familiarity. The goal was clear: the only way to bring Web3 markets to the mainstream is to make them accessible, familiar, and genuinely enjoyable.

And that’s why we built CrowdFeed.

Introducing CrowdFeed
Open XO Market and you’ll see the CrowdFeed, a live feed of markets, each one packaged like a Twitter post you instinctively know how to interact with.

CrowdFeed transforms prediction markets from complex crypto products into something intuitive. Instead of big dashboards or confusing interfaces, markets appear as simple, visual cards in your feed.

Each market states the question, displays real-time odds, and most importantly the market image. Odds shift live, creating an engaging, dynamic experience where users can instantly see the crowd’s convictions in action.

This is all enhanced by our grandma-friendly onboarding. Users sign up with Google, Twitter/X, Wallet, email, etc.. Built-in fiat onramps and account abstraction mean anyone can start trading without prior crypto knowledge. CrowdFeed is the next piece in this puzzle, making scrolling through markets feel familiar from the first interaction.

This isn’t simplicity for simplicity’s sake. CrowdFeed’s intuitive design leads directly to more engagement, more trading, and ultimately, more accurate insights from the crowd.

Why UX Is the Real Unlock
The old model of prediction markets worked for the initiated, but kept the mainstream out. The result: thin markets, shallow liquidity, and “wisdom of the crowd” that barely scratches the surface of what’s possible.

CrowdFeed changes that by lowering the barrier to entry to zero. Onboarding is frictionless. Trading is natural. Even launching your own market is as simple as typing out a tweet. Every layer of complexity stripped away means more users, more insights, and more real-world intelligence flowing into the feed.

By prioritizing accessibility, CrowdFeed unlocks the long-tail potential of conviction markets. When anyone can easily jump in, trade their beliefs, or create new markets, the platform naturally scales.

And as more people participate, the insights only get sharper, meaning markets actually reflect what the crowd thinks, not just what the early adopters are betting.

The Road Ahead
CrowdFeed is another step along our path to mainstream accessibility. Account abstraction is already in play, fiat onboarding is next.

XO Market is going to be grandma friendly.

That’s how you take Web3 mainstream: not with more features for insiders, but with a product that feels effortless for everyone. No jargon. No hoops. Just the crowd and their convictions.
