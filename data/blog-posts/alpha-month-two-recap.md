XO Market Alpha — Month Two Recap

Month one proved conviction trading works. Month two proved it scales.

By month two, XO stopped feeling like a testnet experiment and started feeling like a market feed with a pulse. More users, more markets, and a daily rhythm that’s starting to feel like a real-time ticker for what the internet believes.

The numbers tell one story — volume up, trades up, daily activity steady — but the bigger shift is in how the product feels. People check in daily, adjust their positions when odds move, and step into new markets as soon as they hit the board.

That’s the foundation we wanted before making the next leap.

The Numbers
The headline is consistency; activity didn’t spike and fade — it settled into a daily beat.

~5,000 users (rounded up from last week’s 4.6k)
43,000 total transactions
3,500 transactions in the last 24 hours
$24.1M in volume (test tokens; real conviction)
28,010 trades across 21 markets — 13 active, 8 resolved
118 likes and 815 comments
That mix tells a simple story. Users aren’t just showing up once; the feed is habit-forming. Volume is broad, not concentrated. Participation in comments is high, which is what you want in conviction markets; people clarifying rules, surfacing sources, and making the markets sharper for everyone.

CrowdFeed Goes Live
We also shipped something we’ve wanted since day one: CrowdFeed.

CrowdFeed changes behavior. Instead of a directory, you get a stream. Markets no longer live as static pages you have to hunt for; they stream past like posts you already know how to interact with.

Each card shows the question, the image, and live odds; no dashboards, no jargon, just a scroll-see-act loop. The effect is immediate: discovery happens in-feed, repricings surface in real time, and small markets survive long enough to find their crowd.

It reduces duplicate scrolling because related ideas sit near each other, not scattered across tabs. And it rewards good creators with attention that compounds — if your market is right and timely, it won’t drown under yesterday’s headlines.

The result is a cleaner rhythm. You open XO, scan what’s fresh, catch the repricings, place a position, and come back when outcomes hit. That loop is why conviction markets work. CrowdFeed just reinforces it.

Unique Invite Codes
Mid-month we shipped unique invite codes — a way for Alpha users to share up to three codes with friends, and track when each code was claimed. It did exactly what it was supposed to; the community grew itself. It also did it faster than we planned for at this stage.

Because Alpha is still a closed testnet, the goal isn’t max growth — it’s controlled testing. We’re using Alpha to refine market design, stress-test rails, and tune onboarding before the doors open wider. So we hit pause on invites for now. The feature will return with pacing and limits that let us scale steadily once we open the platform up.

If you’re in, nothing changes — keep trading, keep challenging, keep earning points. If you’re waiting on an invite, hang tight; we’ll bring codes back as we roll into the next phase.

What’s Next?
The next move is the one we’ve been building toward since day one: open market creation.

Phase 3 lets anyone launch a market, set a creator fee, and earn when the crowd shows up. If you have distribution, you have a liquidity engine. If you have timing, you have a fee machine.

A few things to expect as we prep that shift:

Creator guidance: a short, public playbook for seeding and fee settings by category, based on what worked in month two.
Rule templates: stricter defaults for criteria, examples, and exclusions, so new markets resolve the way authors intend.
Feed hygiene: duplicate-idea guardrails, so liquidity stacks instead of fragmenting across paraphrases.
As always, every trade, referral, and challenge earns points. Your PnL and leaderboard position are more than stats; they’ll translate into rewards after Alpha — access, perks, and other rewards for people who consistently perform.

The traders and creators who separated themselves in month two will feel it when we turn the dial.
