Master the art of prediction market trading with this comprehensive guide covering everything from basic concepts to advanced strategies.

## Understanding Prediction Markets

### How Prediction Markets Work

**Market Mechanics**
- Traders buy and sell shares representing different outcomes
- Prices reflect the collective probability assessment
- Winning shares pay out $1, losing shares become worthless
- Market prices range from $0.01 to $0.99 per share

**Price Interpretation**
- A share price of $0.70 suggests 70% probability
- Higher prices indicate higher perceived likelihood
- Price changes reflect new information and sentiment
- Market efficiency improves with more participants

**Share Types**
- **YES shares**: Pay $1 if the prediction comes true
- **NO shares**: Pay $1 if the prediction doesn't come true
- Share prices always sum to approximately $1
- You can hold both YES and NO shares simultaneously

### Market Dynamics

**Information Integration**
- Prices update based on new information
- News events cause rapid price movements
- Markets aggregate diverse perspectives
- Insider information affects trading patterns

**Liquidity and Spreads**
- High liquidity enables easy trading
- Bid-ask spreads reflect market efficiency
- Market makers provide continuous liquidity
- Trading volume indicates market interest

**Time Decay**
- Prices converge toward final outcome
- Volatility typically increases near resolution
- Early positions may be more profitable
- Time remaining affects risk-reward ratios
